// The horizontal rows in the Score. These define the layering of elements on the Stage. Items in lower-numbered channels (rows closer to the top of the Score) are displayed first, with items in higher-numbered channels (rows closer to the bottom of the Score) displayed after, and possibly on top of them. “Sprite x” refers to a Cast member that has been placed in the Score in Channel “x”. The layering sequence is upside-down from that in Photoshop, Illustrator, and Flash.
