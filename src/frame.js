// The vertical columns in the Score. These define the time-based sequence of events during playback. As time passes, playback progresses horizontally from Frame to Frame (left to right). The time it takes to traverse a certain number of Frames depends on many factors. For pure animation in the Score, it is mostly a question of the playback speed (frames-per-second, or fps) assigned to the movie (or that section of the movie), the number and complexity of items in each Frame, and the speed of the computer playing the movie.
